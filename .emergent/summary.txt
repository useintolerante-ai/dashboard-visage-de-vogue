The AI engineer's work primarily involved iteratively building and refining a dynamic sales dashboard, transitioning from initial Excel support to Google Sheets integration. A significant focus was on accurately parsing complex, inconsistent data structures from various Google Sheet tabs, managing total lines to prevent KPI duplication, and handling API rate limits through caching. The development was highly iterative, driven by granular user feedback on numerical discrepancies and UI/UX improvements. Key achievements include implementing accurate  calculations with fuzzy matching (), adding  and  history, developing a dedicated Dias s/ Pagamento tab for overdue clients (initially a column, then revised), resolving data inconsistencies (e.g., client deduplication, specific client value corrections), and implementing an interactive modal for payment forms on the Faturamento KPI. The most recent task involves replacing the Ticket Médio KPI with Entradas R by aggregating all payment forms. Debugging  loops in the frontend was crucial for stable performance.

The user required a dynamic sales dashboard, originally from Excel, now a specific Google Sheet (ID: ). The UI features a modern, dark Visage de Vogue theme with multi-tabbed navigation (Visão Geral, Crediário, Saídas, and a newly added Dias s/ Pagamento). Key KPIs (Faturamento, Saídas, Lucro Bruto, Recebido Crediário) must be accurate and dynamically update for selected months and Ano Inteiro. Nº de Vendas was replaced by Total em Aberto Cred. and Total de Clientes in the overview, and Ticket Médio was added as a 6th KPI, with a pending request to replace it with Entradas R. The Crediário tab needs to list clients with accurate  and display  and  history on click. Clients with  < R, zero, or negative should be excluded. A Dias s/ Pagamento tab was created to list clients > 30 days without payment, sortable, with visual indicators for overdue ranges (30-60, 60-90, 90+ days), using month-based payment logic. The Faturamento KPI in Visão Geral must be clickable to show a modal detailing payment forms (Crediário, PIX, Débito, Dinheiro, Crédito) by month, with values and percentages.

-   
    -   **Summary of why important**: This file is the core backend, handling all API routes, data extraction, processing, aggregation from Google Sheets, and interactions with MongoDB. It defines the logic for calculating KPIs, fetching client data, managing expenses, and extracting payment forms.
    -   **Summary of changes made**:
        -   **Data Extraction & Filtering**: Extensive modifications for Google Sheets API integration and data parsing. Implemented  to accurately calculate KPIs and  with complex logic to identify and exclude total lines.
        -   **Crediário Data**:  was heavily modified to fetch client names, ,  from various sheets, and  ().
        -   **Client Deduplication**: Added logic to prevent duplicate client entries (e.g., Catia Roth).
        -   **Fuzzy Matching**: Introduced  for improved client name matching (e.g., Daiane Defante, ALEKSYA DALLABRIDA).
        -   **Overdue Clients**: Implemented  (initially date-based, then month-based) and  (later ) to identify clients without recent payments.
        -   **Client Filtering**: Filtered out clients with  less than R, zero, or negative.
        -   **New KPIs**: Added  calculation (later to be replaced by ).
        -   **Payment Forms**: Created  endpoint to extract payment method breakdown by month from Google Sheets, handling cases with no data and providing fallbacks.
        -   **Caching**: Implemented caching () to prevent Google Sheets API rate limiting.

-   
    -   **Summary of why important**: The main React component rendering the entire dashboard UI, managing state, making API calls to the backend, and presenting data. It defines the application's visual theme and user interactions.
    -   **Summary of changes made**:
        -   **Theming**: Applied Visage de Vogue dark theme with specific fonts and gradients.
        -   **Navigation**: Implemented multi-tabbed navigation (Visão Geral, Crediário, Saídas, and added Dias s/ Pagamento).
        -   **Crediário Tab**:
            -   Displayed  alongside .
            -   Simplified client list to show only Client and Saldo Devedor in line, with expanded details on click.
            -   Corrected text labels (e.g., compras to vendas).
            -   Decreased font sizes for better visualization.
        -   **Dias s/ Pagamento Tab**:
            -   Initially a panel in Visão Geral, then converted to a dedicated tab.
            -   Displays clients > 30 days without payment, with sorting and visual overdue indicators.
            -   Decreased font sizes.
        -   **KPIs in Visão Geral**:
            -   Removed faturamento vs saída chart and Resumo Crediário pillar.
            -   Replaced Nº Vendas with Total em Aberto Cred. and Total de Clientes.
            -   Added Ticket Médio as a 6th KPI (pending replacement).
            -   Improved KPI layout with a compact, responsive grid.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on implementing the user's request to replace the Ticket Médio KPI with a new KPI called Entradas R. This new KPI is intended to aggregate the total received from all payment forms, specifically , , , , and , to display a comprehensive total of incoming funds. This change aims to provide a more relevant financial metric in the Visão Geral section. The last action taken was acknowledging this request and modifying the  model in . This is the initial step to update the backend data structure before implementing the calculation logic and updating the frontend to display the new KPI.
