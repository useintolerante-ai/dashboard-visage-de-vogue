The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively refining a dynamic sales dashboard, moving from initial Excel support to a Google Sheets integration. A significant challenge involved precisely parsing complex, inconsistent data structures across multiple Google Sheet tabs and handling total lines that caused data duplication in KPIs. The process was highly iterative, with the user providing detailed, granular feedback on specific numerical discrepancies for months like January, and UI/UX improvements (sorting, layout). The AI systematically addressed these, improving data extraction logic in  to filter out erroneous sums, integrating  for better client matching, implementing caching to mitigate Google Sheets API rate limits, and enhancing frontend components in  for sorting and improved Crediário display. The most recent efforts revolve around further enhancing the Crediário tab with accurate  values, payment history, and a new feature for overdue clients.

<product_requirements>
The user required a dynamic sales dashboard, initially from Excel, then a specific Google Sheet (ID: ), updating automatically and manually. The UI should be a modern, dark-themed Visage de Vogue aesthetic with golden gradients. Key KPIs (Faturamento, Saídas, Lucro Bruto, Recebido Crediário, Nº de Vendas) must be displayed accurately, dynamically updating for selected months and Ano Inteiro. Multi-tabbed navigation (Visão Geral, Crediário, Saídas) is essential. The Crediário tab needs to list clients with accurate purchase history (date and value, not payments), dynamically fetch  from the original CREDIARIO sheet, display payment history, and highlight clients 60+ days overdue. Tables for daily sales and expenses should be sortable by clicking headers. A faturamento vs saída chart was requested to be removed. Specific January KPI values were targeted for accuracy: Faturamento R$ 5.339,80, Saídas R$ 11.420,02, Recebido Crediário R$ 3.503,14. The logic for filtering total lines and calculating monthly aggregates must be consistent across all months (January-September).

<code_architecture>

- 
    - **Summary of why important**: This file is the core backend, handling all API routes, data extraction, processing, aggregation from Google Sheets, and interactions with MongoDB. It defines the logic for calculating KPIs, fetching client data, and managing expenses.
    - **Summary of changes made**:
        - Extensive modifications for Google Sheets API integration and data parsing.
        - Implemented  to accurately calculate Faturamento, Saídas, Lucro Bruto, Recebido Crediário, and Nº de Vendas, with complex logic to identify and exclude total lines in various columns and formats across different monthly sheets.
        -  was heavily modified to fetch client names,  from the CREDIARIO sheet, and  from the CREDIARIO POR CONTRATO sheet, handling their distinct structures.
        -  was updated to apply the same precise filtering logic for daily sales data.
        - Introduced  for improved client name matching for .
        - Implemented caching () to prevent Google Sheets API rate limiting (429 errors).
        - Logic generalized to apply correct calculations and filtering across all months (January to September).

- 
    - **Summary of why important**: The main React component rendering the entire dashboard UI, managing state, making API calls to the backend, and presenting data.
    - **Summary of changes made**:
        - Applied Visage de Vogue dark theme, including specific fonts, color gradients, and layout adjustments.
        - Implemented multi-tabbed navigation (Visão Geral, Crediário, Saídas).
        - Removed the faturamento vs saída chart as per user request.
        - Added interactive sorting functionality to table headers (Faturamento Diário, Saídas, Crediário clients) for ascending/descending order.
        - Corrected text labels (e.g., pagamentos to compras, Histórico de Pagamentos to Histórico de Compras).
        - Enhanced Crediário tab layout: added Clientes, Total Vendas, Compras, Saldo Devedor headers, and refined value alignment.
        - Updated fetch calls to new backend endpoints and data structures.

- 
    - **Summary of changes made**: Added  dependency.

<pending_tasks>
- Correct  for specific clients (e.g., Daiane Defante).
- Add  alongside purchase history in the Crediário tab.
- Implement a feature to identify clients 60+ days without payment (overdue clients).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing three explicit user requests related to the  tab. First, a correction is needed for the  calculation, as it's not updating correctly for some clients, specifically mentioned is Daiane Defante. The AI engineer's last action in  was an edit to  to refine  calculation, likely to improve client name matching or data retrieval logic. Second, the user requested to add  (payment history) to the  tab, to be displayed alongside the already implemented  (purchase history). Third, a new feature is required: a dedicated column or mechanism to identify  (clients overdue by more than 60 days). The AI has acknowledged these tasks and is planning the next steps to implement them, starting with verifying the  correction and then proceeding with the new features.

<optional_next_step>
Test if the  correction (fuzzy matching) worked, then implement payment history and the overdue clients feature.
